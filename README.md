# Data-Governance-and-Security-Dashboard

## Dataset Overview

The World Bank's ESG Data Draft dataset offers insights into 17 key sustainability themes categorized under Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). The World Bank Group (WBG) aims to align financial flows with global objectives by enhancing financial markets with improved data and analytics to highlight countries' sustainability performance. This dataset, combined with new research, will help explore the relationship between sustainability metrics and investment risks and returns.

## Project Objective

Develop an interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes ESG data by country, enabling effective comparison and analysis.

## Data Preparation

Country Code: Identifies the country (e.g., "USA" for the United States, "IND" for India).

Series Code: Represents various ESG indicators (e.g., CO2 emissions, renewable energy usage, social welfare index).

## Key Objectives

Visualize ESG indicators for multiple countries in an interactive format.

Implement category-based filtering for Environment, Social, and Governance data.

Provide detailed descriptions for each Series Code through interactive tooltips or panels.
